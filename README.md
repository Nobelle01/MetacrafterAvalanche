# Project Title

Smart Contract with require(), assert(), and revert() Statements

## Description

This project provides a smart contract written in Solidity that demonstrates the usage of require(), assert(), and revert() statements. The smart contract allows for the transfer of tokens between addresses and includes checks to ensure the validity of the transfer. It also showcases how to handle unexpected errors and restrict access to certain functions using the revert statement.

## Getting Started

### Installing

To download the project, you can clone the repository using the following command:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git


### Executing program

To run the smart contract using Gitpod, follow these steps:

1. Open Gitpod: Open your browser and go to https://www.gitpod.io/.
2. Connect to GitHub: Sign in to your GitHub account and authorize Gitpod to access your repositories.
3. Create a New Workspace: Click on the "Gitpod" button in your repository to create a new Gitpod workspace.
4. Wait for the Workspace to Start: Gitpod will set up your workspace and install the necessary dependencies. This may take a few moments.
5. Open Terminal: Once the workspace is ready, you'll see the IDE. In the bottom panel, click on the "Terminal" tab to open a terminal window.
6. Compile the Contract: In the terminal, run the following command to compile the Solidity contract:
      solc --bin --abi SmartContract.sol
   
   This command will generate the bytecode and ABI (Application Binary Interface) for the contract.
7. Deploy the Contract: Deploy the contract to a local development network or a test network like Ropsten or Rinkeby. You can use tools like Remix IDE, Truffle, or Hardhat to deploy and interact with the contract. Make sure to fund the contract address with some initial tokens for testing purposes.
8. Test the Contract: Write test cases to verify the behavior of the contract using different scenarios. You can use a testing framework like Truffle, Hardhat, or even write custom JavaScript/TypeScript tests to interact with the deployed contract and check if the require(), assert(), and revert() statements work as expected.

## Help

If you encounter any issues or have any questions, you can refer to the Solidity documentation for more information. Additionally, you can seek help from the Solidity community through forums such as the Ethereum Stack Exchange or developer community channels.
